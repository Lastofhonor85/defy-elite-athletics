        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m <strong>Steven Edward Kittinger Jr.</strong>, an ACSM-certified personal trainer with a Bachelor’s in Sports &amp; Recreation Sciences. I’ve coached a broad spectrum of clients—from family members (my niece and sister-in-law) to military personnel on an Army installation—and have experience in both commercial gyms and youth recreation. Early in my career, I served as Athletic Director for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of SWC and oversaw recreation programs for the U.S. Army.</p>
        <p>Having played every sport since age three—basketball, baseball, soccer, golf, and football—I later coached and refereed youth teams in each. My daughters’ success in competitive junior golf under my guidance inspired me to launch Defy Elite Athletics and bring my experience to a wider community.</p>
        <p>Whether you’re an elite golfer seeking lower handicaps or someone pursuing better overall fitness, I combine hands-on coaching with science-driven programming to help you defy limits and reach your personal best.</p>
